# autogen-relnotes-example

This repository is pretty bare. But it will (hopefully) demonstrate how automatically generated release notes in GitHub can work.

Now there's a `release.yml` which should make better release notes - that's pretty cool! And when a new tag is pushed, the [release workflow](./github/workflows/release.yml) will automatically draft release notes.
